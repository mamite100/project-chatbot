# Chat bot 
This project was made on week 4 for Technigo bootcamp as pair programming project. 
It was made by me Mamite Andersson and Julia Nikitina github: JuliaNiki. 
The project's aim was to practice some parts of JavaScript we've learnt so far by creating a chat bot! We got more familiar with variables, conditionals statements, event listeners and understanding the flow.

## The problem

We found this project pretty challenging for the real first week with Javascript, but we got an inspiration from Technigo's example of Pizza bot, knowledge from weekly materials and some help from live sessions with our school. 
We learned a lot by doing this project and we are very proud of how it looks and how it interacts with the user. 
If we had more time, we would also experiment with audio and not only videos and probably will play around with a date picker to let the user choose time and day for the procedure.
